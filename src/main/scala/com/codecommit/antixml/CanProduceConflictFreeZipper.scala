/**
 * Trait which signifies a special type of [[scala.collection.generic.CanBuildFrom]],
 * capable of lifting itself into an instance of [[com.codecommit.antixml.CanBuildFromWithConflictFreeZipper]].
 * Note that even though all CanBuildFrom instances for Traversable targets are
 * implicitly liftable into [[com.codecommit.antixml.CanBuildFromWithConflictFreeZipper]],
 * this lifting is generic and often different from the results of the `lift`
 * method defined by this trait.
 *
 * In practice, this trait is used as a marker trait by the utility methods
 * on [[com.codecommit.antixml.ConflictFreeZipper]] (particularly `map` and `flatMap`).
 * Without this trait, it would be impossible to distinguish zippable collection
 * types from non-zippable collection types while preserving the override of
 * these methods.
